CS Build Week Conway's Game of Life in React (Jesus Rodriguez 2020)

---

> A cellular automaton aka cellular automata consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states, such as on and off or dead and alive. For each cell or grid, a set of cells called its neighborhood is defined relative to the specified cell. This program allows us to view store data on a 2D graph.

>Turing complete is a term used in computability theory to describe abstract machines, usually called automata. We can write code to run an algorithim to simulate the generations. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
